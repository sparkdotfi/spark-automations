# ‚ö°Ô∏èü¶æ Spark Keepers ‚ö°Ô∏èü¶æ

This repository contains all Keepers used in the Spark ecosystem to executed automated transactions. Powered by Gelato.

## üèéÔ∏èüò§ TLDR

1. Make sure to have `yarn` and `node` installed
2. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
3. Run `yarn test` to run tests
4. Set all necessary environment variables
5. Run `yarn gelato:deploy` to deploy all of the keepers

## ‚öôÔ∏èüß∞ Project Setup

### ‚úèÔ∏è Prerequisites

In order to install the project and run scripts you need to have `node` and `yarn` installed on your machine. There are no specific versioning requirements, but version `node 20.12.2` and `yarn 1.22.19` are proved to be working.

### üóúÔ∏è Install project dependencies

```
yarn install
```

### üìö Configure local environment

Create your own `.env` file and complete it with these settings

```bash
ALCHEMY_ID= # API key used to create forked test environments
GELATO_KEYSTORE_PATH= # Absolute path to a keystore wallet that will manage your deployments.
GELATO_PASSWORD_PATH= # Absolute path to a keystore wallet password
GELATO_KEEPERS_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL= # Slack Webhook URL that will be used by the keepers to send notifications
GELATO_KEEPERS_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY= # Paid Etherscan API key that will be used by the keepers to query historical gas prices
```

Additionally if you don't have these variables set in your environment, add:

```bash
MAINNET_RPC_URL= # Complete Ethereum Mainnet RPC URL that will be used for keeper deployments
GNOSIS_CHAIN_RPC_URL= # Complete Gnosis Chain RPC URL that will be used for keeper deployments
```

Alternatively, if there is no keystore on the machine the scripts are running on, you can use plain private key:

```bash
GELATO_PRIVATE_KEY= # A private key (it's usage is going to prioritized over accessing the keystore)
```

Additionally make sure to define all of the env variables used in keeper secrets the `scripts/configs` files.

## ‚öñÔ∏èüëÄ Testing

In order to run all the tests, run:

```bash
yarn test
```

Alternatively, in order to run only part of the tests, run on of the following:

```bash
yarn test:mainnet # Tests on mainnet fork for keepers operating on mainnet
yarn test:gnosis # Tests on gnosis chain fork for keepers operating on gnosis chain
yarn test:base # Tests on base chain fork for keepers operating on base chain
yarn test:utils # Tests of utils, not executed on forked environment
```

## üö¢üöÄ Deployment

Deployment of a keeper consists of 2 subsequent steps.

1. The code of the keeper has to be uploaded to IPFS
2. An on-chain instance of a keeper running a code deployed at a specific IPFS address with proper arguments needs to be created and secrets needed to operate the keeper need to be set.

### ‚õìÔ∏è On-Chain Deployment

In order to spin-up operating instances of keepers, run the following command (make sure to have all of the environment variables properly set):

```bash
yarn gelato:deploy
```

First the script will upload all code to IPFS and determine for which keeper types to run the actual deployment script. The deployment will not be triggered if a given IPFS deployment combined with a configuration is already deployed. Otherwise, the deployment will be performed.

The exact number of instances, their names, arguments, and configuration are defined in config files. The arguments used to spin-up the keeper are passed along with the deployment transaction and can only be changed by redeploying the keeper instance. Secrets are set in separate transactions, after the initial deployment and their value can be changed at any time via UI or a script.

Any time the script is run, all previously running keepers are retired, except keepers that have the same code logic (IPFS hash) and configuration.

In order to force the redeployment of the keeper, use `-f` of `--forceRedeploy` flag.
In order to perform a script dry run, without actually performing any actions, use `-d` or `--dryRun` flag.
The script will ask for a confirmation before every deployment. If a fully automated run is needed, run it with `-n` or `--noConfirm` flag.

You can check description of all of the options by running the script with `-h` or `--help` flag.

## ü™öüñçÔ∏è Misc

### üîë Key Check

In order to make sure that your keystore paths are configured correctly run:

```bash
yarn gelato:checkKey
```

This script will try to access the key that variables `GELATO_KEYSTORE_PATH` and `GELATO_PASSWORD_PATH` point to and will print the address that was decrypted.

### üìú Active Keepers List

In order to list all currently active Keepers run:

```bash
yarn gelato:list
```

This command will list all of the currently running Keepers' names and ids.
